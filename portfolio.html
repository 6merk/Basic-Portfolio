<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>My name is Mark Kahler and I'm 27 years old. I was born and raised in Abu Dhabi which is near Dubai in the United Arab Emirates. Ethnically I'm half Indian and German and am relatively new to Los Angeles and have been here for a little over a year now. I graduated from Arizona State University with a Bachelors in Business/Sociology. I currently work at AAA as an emergency roadside service operator and also work part time at a smoothie shop called Renovo.</p1>
